# HDA_project

This folder contains the source code for Human Data Analytics Course project. 

In this work we developed and compared several deep learning models for solving task A and task B2 of the 
"Opportunity Activity Recognition" challenge. 

The repository is organized as follows:

- folder task A : it contains the source code and the Keras models to solve task A.
- folder task B2 : it contains the source code and the Keras models to solve task B2.
- folder pre_processing: it contains Matlab code to process the raw data, fill the missing values and generate .csv files for the
  code. 
- folder post_processing: it contains the python code to visualize the name of the different channels ordered by variance and 
  visualize the meaningfull result.
